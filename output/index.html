        <h1># mailtester</h1>
        <h2>## Installation</h2>
        <p>Before first email, mail tester must be setup to use appropriate mail server in `settings.js` file. By default `settings.js` file is ready for gmail account (only username and password required), but any other mail server is supported ([nodemailer](https://www.npmjs.com/package/nodemailer#sponsors) is used to actually send emails).</p>

        <h2>## Usage</h2>

        <h3>### npm test</h3>
        <p>Sends email, where source file is defined in `settings.js` file. Non-absolute images must be linked relatively to the file (without './').</p>

        <h3>### npm start</h3>
        <p>Starts browserSync on port 3000 with source folder defined in `settings.js`. HTML gets updated in browser on save of file without reload.</p>
